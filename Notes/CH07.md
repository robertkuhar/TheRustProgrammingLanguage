# Chapter 7: Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

## BobK Notes

I think the chapter is so confusing because "Packages" really aren't a formal Rust concept.  "In the
beginning" I think Rust has only "Modules" and "Crates" are a means of bundling the Modules. 

### Rust 1.0 book docs

A google search turned up a previous iteration of "the book" that sums the relationship between
Crates and Modules a little better: https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/book/crates-and-modules.html

"Rust has two distinct terms that relate to the module system: ‘crate’ and ‘module’. 
A crate is synonymous with a ‘library’ or ‘package’ in other languages."

"Each crate has an implicit root module that contains the code for that crate. You can then define 
a tree of sub-modules under that root module. Modules allow you to partition your code within the 
crate itself."

### restaurant from "The Book"

```
$ cargo new --lib ch07_restaurant
     Created library `ch07_restaurant` package
$ tree ch07_restaurant/
ch07_restaurant/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── lib.rs

1 directory, 2 files
```
